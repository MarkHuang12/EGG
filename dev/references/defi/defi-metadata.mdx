title: '3. DeFi Metadata'
description: 'DeFi Integration for wfragAsset'
---

To provide visibility into your pool’s status within the Fragmetric platform, you must supply metadata about your DeFi pool, including **TVL** and **APY**. This data will be shown on the Fragmetric app alongside F Point information to give users a clear view of where their funds are deployed and how they’re performing.

## Integration Requirements
```json
{
  "apy": 0.4655,
  "tvl": "1234000000000"
}
```
- `apy`: Annual percentage yield, as a decimal. (e.g., 0.4655 = 46.55%)
- `tvl`: Total value locked in the pool. The unit can be: USD, SOL or the relevant wfragAsset. (e.g., wfragSOL, wfragBTC, etc.)

## Options for Integration

### 1. Provide a Custom API Endpoint
You may expose a minimal REST API returning the structure above. We'll consume this endpoint periodically and associate it with your pool based on a consistent `pool address`.

### 2. Provide an Integration Guide
If you already publish TVL and APY via your own analytics API or frontend, simply share:
- The public URL or API.
- How to derive tvl and apy values for your pool.
- How to match your internal pool identifier with the pool address used in our system.

We do not require you to build a new API. We only need a **reliable way to extract the data**, aligned with the same `pool address` used for F Point snapshotting.
