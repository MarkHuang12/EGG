title: '5. Caution for Deposit Instruction'
description: 'DeFi Integration for wfragAsset'
---

If your protocol integrates Fragmetric’s deposit logic by manually constructing and including an instruction either:
- `user_deposit_sol`
- `user_deposit_supported_token`

..you must ensure that **all required pricing source accounts** are included in the transaction.
These accounts are **not declared in the IDL** and must be resolved explicitly — either manually, via SDK, or through a dedicated ALT (Address Lookup Table).

<Warning>
    Do not hardcode account lists.
    Do not assume the current set of accounts will remain valid after governance updates (e.g. adding supported tokens or vaults).
</Warning>

## What Are Pricing Source Accounts?
These accounts are used to price deposits and determine how much fragAsset should be minted.
They are derived from the **dynamic configuration of the fund**, and may vary over time or between assets (e.g., `fragSOL`, `fragJTO`, `fragBTC`).

### Ground Rules for Required Accounts
For every `fragAsset` fund, you must include accounts of:
- `fund.supported_tokens[0:fund.num_supported_tokens].pricing_source.address`
- `fund.restaking_vaults[0:fund.num_restaking_vaults].pricing_source.address`
- `fund.normalized_token.pricing_source.address` — only if `fund.normalized_token.enabled == 1`

<Note>
    Some accounts may appear multiple times (especially in `fragBTC`, which consists of pegged assets).
    You can manually deduplicate these accounts when building your transaction.
</Note>

## How to Include These Accounts
You can derive this list by reading the on-chain fund account data for each `fragAsset`, following the rules above.
Also there are two safe, forward-compatible options to resolve these accounts:

- **Use the SDK**: The `@fragmetric-labs/sdk` will resolve all required pricing source accounts for you based on the latest fund state.

- **Use a dedicated Address Lookup Table (ALT)**: Each fund has a dedicated ALT, which includes only all required pricing source addresses.
Use this ALT to avoid manually deriving the accounts in your transaction. Fragmetric will update this ALT ahead of an instruction of new support tokens.

### 1. Use the SDK to build an instruction
You can build a full deposit transaction. And if you need unsigned transaction or just a part of the instructions. you can just build a blueprint transaction without serialize it.
Check [Tools > Fragmetric SDK (offchain) > Deposit](/dev/tools/sdk/offchain/quickstart#3-deposit) for details.

### 2. Read the addresses from the fund account
You can read addresses directly from the fund account before build a deposit instruction to include all required pricing sources.
There are below fields containing pricing source account information in the **fund account** data like below:

```rust
/// ... starts from data offset: 0x9000
num_pricing_source_addresses: u8,
pricing_source_addresses: [Pubkey; 33],
```

Check [Developers > Solana Programs](/dev/solana-programs#fragmetric-liquid-restaking-program) for the address of fund accounts.
