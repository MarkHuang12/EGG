While our system undergoes rigorous security assessments, we actively encourage community members, ethical hackers, and researchers to conduct independent contract reviews. We plan to open-source the project after conducting additional security checks on specific details.

If any vulnerabilities are discovered, please report them to [**admin@fragmetric.xyz**]() or through appropriate channels.
