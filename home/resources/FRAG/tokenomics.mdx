## Token Utility

### 1. Governance Participation
- **Staking for Voting Power**: Token holders can stake FRAG to FRAG² and get FVT (Fragmetric Vote Token) to participate in protocol governance
- **Time Weighted Voting**: Longer staking duration let more FVT which leads to more voting power, encouraging long term alignment
- **Governance Scope**:
  - Protocol parameter adjustments
  - Node Operator selection and management
  - Fund Manager appointments
  - Protocol upgrade decisions
  - Incentive distribution mechanisms

### 2. Fragmetric Grants Program
- Staked FRAG holders vote on grant allocations
- Supports ecosystem development and innovation
- Funds community driven initiatives

### 3. FRAG² Rewards
- Earn additional incentives through FRAG staking
- Boost F Points accumulation in future LF(ra)G Campaign seasons
- Enhanced rewards for longer staking commitments


The FRAG token represents a critical evolution in the Fragmetric Protocol's journey toward full decentralization. By placing governance power in the hands of users and contributors, FRAG ensures that the protocol's future development aligns with community interests while maintaining the security and efficiency that has made Fragmetric the leading liquid restaking protocol on Solana.
