**SANG** is an abbreviation for **SolanA Network Guard**, and it refers to our community members who restake their tokens using Fragmetric. By becoming a SANG, you become more than just a user; you become a protector of the Solana ecosystem, contributing to the security and enhancement of both on-chain and off-chain services.

But here's a cool fact: **our cofounder's name is also** [**Sang**](https://x.com/sangdotsol?ref=docs.fragmetric.xyz). He embodies the spirit of SANG by leading and participating as a full member of our community. This means that when you join us as a SANG, you'll be working alongside our cofounder to protect and grow the Solana network.

By joining SANG, you're doing more than just protecting your own assets. You are actively contributing to the growth and protection of the entire Solana ecosystem. We collaborate on research, develop new solutions, and launch innovative products such as NCN/AVS. Our collective efforts ensure that Solana remains decentralized, trustworthy, and continues to thrive.

Essentially, anyone can join Fragmetric at the same level as our cofounder by gaining the role of a SANG. We're all working together to protect and expand the Solana ecosystem, and we'd love for you to join us. Participating in Fragmetric makes you part of the community that drives Solana forward.
