## Overview

Fragmetric began as **Solana’s first native liquid (re)staking protocol** and evolved into the advanced **FRAG-22 asset management standard**. This new standard seamlessly integrates multi-asset deposits, precise reward distribution, and modular yield sourcing, empowering both developers and users to efficiently access sophisticated DeFi strategies.

Leveraging Solana’s Token extension, FRAG-22 provides transparent, real time reward tracking and superior liquidity management. With clearly defined operational roles and secure protocols, Fragmetric sets a benchmark for composability, scalability, and user experience within the Solana ecosystem.

Fragmetric’s mission is to build a **secure**, **transparent**, and **highly efficient** asset management infrastructure that empowers users and enhances the stability of Solana’s financial and security ecosystem.

**Stake Twice, Earn More.**
