## Overview

Fragmetric is the **first Solana-native liquid (re)staking protocol**, with a vision of enhancing the Solana ecosystem's security and economic potential while enabling (re)stakers to earn stable returns.

By leveraging Solana's token extension, Fragmetric has effectively implemented various reward distribution mechanisms. Furthermore, it has designed practical solutions such as the Normalized Token Program to support the use of various LSTs in restaking platforms.

Fragmetricâ€™s mission is to build a **secure**, **transparent**, and **highly efficient** (re)staking infrastructure that empowers users and supports the stability of the Solana's (re)staking ecosystem.

**Stake Twice, Earn More.**
