<Tab title="TipRouter">
### TipRouter (Jito Labs)

- **Decentralized MEV Distribution**: TipRouter is a NCN that securely and transparently distributes MEV Tips across the SOL stakers.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: It employs a network of independent node operators who collaboratively generate a Merkle root representing the correct distribution of tips. This root is submitted to an onchain ballot box program, and upon achieving a supermajority consensus (>67%), rewards are distributed accordingly.
- **Economic Security via Restaking**: The system is economically secured through the restaking of assets like JitoSOL and JTO, providing restakers with additional yield opportunities and enhancing the overall security of the network.
