## Upgrade Authority Owner

### Multisig Committees

Fragmetric's deployed programs are designed to be upgradeable for several key reasons. First, as the protocol is rolled out in multiple phases, program upgrades are necessary to enable careful adjustments to core protocol parameters. Second, upgradability ensures that the team can respond swiftly in case of emergencies, maintaining the security and stability of the platform.

All deployed programs within Fragmetric are governed by a multisig, managed by multiple core contributors. As the protocol evolves, the multisig governance structure will gradually expand to include members of the broader Fragmetric ecosystem, further enhancing decentralization.

Fragmetric uses Squads v4, Solanaâ€™s leading multisig infrastructure. This system has undergone multiple security audits, and Squads Protocol v4 has successfully completed two formal verifications, ensuring its robustness and reliability.
