fragBTC is the first yield-bearing Bitcoin, co-launched by Fragmetric, Solv Protocol, and Zeus Network. By staking BTC-pegged assets, you receive fragBTC, which offers a compelling opportunity to earn sustainable yields while contributing to Solana's DeFi growth.

### How fragBTC Works

fragBTC generates its base yield through SolvBTC.JUP, a BTC yield strategy built by Solv Protocol. This strategy sources BTC-denominated returns by providing liquidity to the Jupiter Liquidity Provider (JLP) Pool on Jupiter Exchange.

To reduce exposure to market volatility, SolvBTC.JUP applies a delta-neutral approach, offering risk-adjusted yield profiles designed to accommodate varying levels of risk tolerance among Bitcoin holders.

fragBTC starts with SolvBTC.JUP and will expand to a variety of BTCFi strategies, allowing users to stake their Bitcoin-pegged assets on Solana while maintaining liquidity and earning yields.

### Why fragBTC Matters for Bitcoin Holders and Solana

FragBTC marks a pioneering effort at the intersection of Bitcoin and the Solana ecosystem.

- For Bitcoin holders, it unlocks a reliable avenue to earn yield while preserving both BTC exposure and on-chain liquidity — tackling the long-standing inefficiency of idle Bitcoin capital.
- For the Solana network, fragBTC introduces deep Bitcoin liquidity that enhances overall capital efficiency.

By combining this sustainable yield-generating model with Solana’s fast transactions and low fees, fragBTC is positioned to solve the long-standing issue of over \$1 trillion in idle BTC capital.
