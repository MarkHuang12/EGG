fragBTC is the first yield-bearing Bitcoin, co-launched by Fragmetric, Solv Protocol, and Zeus Network. By staking BTC-pegged asset, you receive fragBTC, which offers a compelling opportunity to earn sustainable yields while contributing to Solana's DeFi growth.

### How fragBTC Works

fragBTC generates its base yield through SolvBTC.JUp, a BTC yield strategy built by Solv Protocol. This strategy sources BTC-denominated returns by providing liquidity to the Jupiter Liquidity Provider (JLP) Pool on Jupiter Exchange. 

To reduce exposure to market volatility, SolvBTC.JUP applies a delta-neutral approach, offering risk-adjusted yield profiles designed to accommodate varying levels of risk tolerance among Bitcoin holders.

fragBTC starts with SolvBTC.JUP and will expand to a variety of BTCFi strategies, allowing users to stake their Bitcoin on Solana while maintaining liquidity and earning yields. 

### Why fragBTC Matters for Bitcoin Holders and Solana

**FragBTC marks a pioneering effort at the intersection of Bitcoin and the Solana ecosystem.**

- For Bitcoin holders, it unlocks a reliable avenue to earn yield while preserving both BTC exposure and on-chain liquidity â€” tackling the long-standing inefficiency of idle Bitcoin capital.
- For the Solana network, fragBTC introduces deep Bitcoin liquidity that enhances overall capital efficiency. Additionally, the Institutional Guardian framework contributes to securing restaking infrastructure, supporting the foundation for sustainable DeFi growth.
