fragSOL is Solana’s first Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) and the culmination of Fragmetric’s technological innovation. By restaking SOL or other Liquid Staking Tokens (JitoSOL, mSOL, BNSOL, or bbSOL) through the Fragmetric protocol, you receive fragSOL, which represents your restaked SOL or LST and entitles you to:

- **Solana Staking Yield:** Fragmetric collaborates with top-tier yield-focused protocols, aiming to deliver competitive returns to fragSOL holders.
- **MEV Rewards:** All SOL and LSTs deposited into Fragmetric are used to secure TipRouter, the first Node Consensus Network (NCN) under Jito Restaking. MEV tips generated from these activities are distributed to fragSOL holders, boosting overall APY.
- **Additional Restaking Revenue:** With integrations on the Jito (Re)staking Protocol, including collaborations with NCNs, Fragmetric efficiently redistributes extra restaking rewards to fragSOL holders.
  - **Switchboard NCN Rewards: **The amount to distribute is governed by the Switchboard DAO through [svSWTCH governance](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/gitbook-on-demand/blob/main/switchboard-protocol/governance-and-tokenomics.md), with the initial year set to distribute 8% of supply to stakers.
    - **Reward Calculation:**
      - Based on your proportional share of total staked assets
      - Distributed from protocol fees and SWTCH subsidies
      - Higher oracle performance = higher rewards for delegators

    For complete details on tokenomics and reward distribution, see the [SWTCH Token Overview](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/gitbook-on-demand/blob/main/switchboard-protocol/swtch-token-overview.md) and [Governance & Tokenomics](https://github.com/switchboard-xyz/gitbook-on-demand/blob/main/switchboard-protocol/governance-and-tokenomics.md) guides.

<Info>
  Rewards within the protocol are distributed in two ways: 

  - When NCN/AVS rewards are distributed in tokens that can be deposited back into fragSOL, the protocol uses auto-compounding to increase fragSOL’s APY. 
  - If the rewards are paid in tokens not supported for deposit, users can manually claim those tokens at any time. This dual approach ensures the best possible yield for fragSOL while giving users direct control over any non-compounding rewards.
