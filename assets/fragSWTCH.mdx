fragSWTCH is the staked version of SWTCH, the native token of the Switchboard oracle network that powers governance, economic security, and real-time data at scale, introduced through an exclusive partnership between Fragmetric and Switchboard.

By (re)staking SWTCH through the Fragmetric protocol, you receive fragSWTCH, which represents your staked assets and gain access to all utilities, including:

  <Tab title="Governance">
    **fragSWTCH grants direct voting power over the future of the Switchboard protocol**, enabling holders to make decisions around:

    - Node onboarding, performance requirements, and slashing conditions
    - Staking, delegation, and reward parameters
    - Core protocol fee structures
    - Priority technical upgrades and integrations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Oracle Incentives">
    To participate in the network and validate data, **oracle operators must have fragSWTCH delegated to them**. This "skin in the game" model ensures oracle operator incentives are directly aligned with their respective contributions to data reliability and network health. Prioritization and workload distribution among oracles is determined by a combination of their performance metrics and the total fragSWTCH delegated to them. This competitive dynamic rewards high performing nodes with more work and, consequently, more rewards.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rewards">
    Switchboard’s economic engine is designed to be self-sustaining. Enabling:

    1. **Fee Collection:** Network fees (paid in SOL or each chain's native gas token) are collected from every data feed interaction.
    2. **Rewards Vault:** These fees, supplemented by a SWTCH token subsidy, are deposited into a dedicated protocol rewards vault.
    3. **Autonomous Distribution:** The accumulated assets are distributed as rewards at specific intervals. The Jito NCN vault managers and configurations are responsible for overseeing this distribution, ensuring **rewards are fairly allocated to oracle node operators and SWTCH stakers**.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Enhanced Data Access">
    **For dapps and high-volume data users, staking SWTCH provides higher rate limits**, ensuring fair resource allocation, preventing spam, and prioritizing legitimate, high-demand applications invested in the protocol’s success. Higher rate limits also allow users to take advantage of high speed features such as Switchboard Surge.

### How to stake SWTCH

To wield the true power of SWTCH and access the full set of utilities mentioned above, holders can stake their SWTCH (and mint fragSWTCH) using Fragmetric Vault. [<u>https://app.fragmetric.xyz/restake/</u>](https://app.fragmetric.xyz/restake/)

> Rewards within the protocol are distributed as follows: Switchboard Oracle Network fees together with SWTCH subsidies fund the Fragmetric Restaking Vault, and the protocol auto-compounds these rewards into fragSWTCH.
