title: "Wrap & Unwrap (DeFi Mode)"
---

wfragSOL & wfragJTO are wrapped versions of fragSOL & fragJTO, designed for broader DeFi compatibility. Some DeFi protocols do not support Token Extension (also known as Token-2022), an advanced token program on the Solana blockchain. To address this, we created wfragSOL and wfragJTO as DeFi-compatible versions of fragSOL and fragJTO, with the wrapped tokens pegged to their respective tokens.

When wrapping fragSOL to wfragSOL, the desired amount of fragSOL is locked in the wfragSOL program-owned token account, and wfragSOL is minted at a 1:1 peg.

When unwrapping, wfragSOL gets burnt and the corresponding amount of fragSOL gets unlocked.
