The Operator manages staking, restaking, withdrawal operations, and the execution of restaking strategies. It handles all asset flows from the fund and rewards, and configures the investment strategy through integration with various staking and restaking protocols.

The Operator in Protocol is responsible for managing asset movements according to dynamically changing configurations. These configurations are adjusted based on withdrawal requests and the governance-driven restaking portfolio.

The Operator ensures the reconciliation of asset amounts between the fund, reserved fund, restaking protocols, and staking protocols. Its tasks include setting target amounts for the reserved fund account (to handle withdrawal requests) and determining unstaking and restaking amounts to maintain these targets. It configures investment allocations and delegates funds to NCN Node Operator based on the latest configurations.

### Staking Protocol Adaptor

Fragmetric currently supports staking protocols such as Jito, Marinade, and Binance with plans to include more in the future. Since each protocol's implementation is not standardized, we need to generalize the interface for each staking protocol. This module creates an abstract layer for each protocol, and each adaptor implements its protocol through cross-program invocation based on that interface, as invoked by the Operator. It includes methods for staking and unstaking.

### Restaking Protocol Adaptor

Similar to the Staking Protocol Adaptor, Restaking Protocol Adapter supports restaking to various NCN, including TipRouter, Switchboard, and Squads. It creates an abstract layer for each NCN and implements methods for restaking and unstaking. Additionally, it optionally implements a delegation rebalancing method to adjust the delegation amounts for opted-in NCN Node Operator within the restaking protocol.
