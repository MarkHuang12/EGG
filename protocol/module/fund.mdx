# **FRAG-22 : Fund Module**

---

## **Overview**

The Fund module serves as the core custody, liquidity management, and accounting engine within the FRAG-22 ecosystem. It securely manages user deposits and withdrawals, maintains precise on-chain records, and ensures liquidity efficiency. By providing robust fund management and transparent accounting, it lays the foundation for secure and efficient decentralized asset management.
