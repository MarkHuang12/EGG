## FRAG-22 

### Fragmetric Asset Standard

The **FRAG-22 standard** represents an advanced asset tokenization framework developed by Fragmetric, built upon Solana’s innovative Token 2022 - **transfer hook**. Initially utilized for liquid restaking, the standard now provides robust capabilities to support multiple asset deposits, diverse reward distributions, and seamless adoption of various yield-generating strategies beyond traditional staking solutions.

### **Expansion Beyond Restaking**

Fragmetric initially introduced the **FRAG-22** standard to support its Liquid Restaking Tokens, allowing multiple LSTs to be deposited, automatically generating and accurately distributing multiple reward streams created by NCNs. With this robust and modular infrastructure, restaking served as the first use case demonstrating the standard’s potential.

Recognizing broader opportunities, Fragmetric expanded the standard’s applicability beyond restaking, integrating diverse yield generation methods into a unified, composable token architecture. This expansion enables FRAG-22 assets to seamlessly integrate with liquidity pools, lending protocols, structured DeFi products, and more complex yield-generation strategies.

  <Step title="Modular Yield Integration Framework" icon="link-horizontal" iconType="duotone" titleSize="p">
    FRAG-22 is architected with a highly modular design, facilitating rapid integration and adoption of diverse yield sources. This framework supports a plug-and-play model for incorporating liquidity pools, lending platforms, structured financial products, yield farms, and emerging decentralized finance strategies. The protocol's adaptable architecture ensures quick scalability and continuous expansion of yield opportunities, allowing Fragmetric to dynamically respond to market innovations and user demands, consistently optimizing user returns and capital efficiency.

    > We believe that the FRAG-22 standard will unlock innovative token use cases within the Solana ecosystem by enabling seamless adoption of diverse decentralized yield sources, including but not limited to restaking services.
