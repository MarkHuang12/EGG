## Three key Objectives of Fragmetric

<Steps>
  <Step title="Develop a secure standard for Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)">
    Fragmetric develops and maintains a top-notch standard for LRTs that ensures accurate reward distribution to users. With the established LRT standard, LRTs can be used across various protocols, enabling users to earn restaking rewards and additional revenue at the same time.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delegate user’s deposit to the secure and profitable Restaking Protocol, NCN/AVS">
    Fragmetric will establish a governance-based Risk Management Committee to verify the profitability and secureness of NCN and AVS, ensuring optimal rewards for users in the future.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Contribute to the growth of Solana’s restaking ecosystem with SANG">
    By restaking with Fragmetric, users become **SANG (SolanA Network Guard)**—guardians who secure and enhance Solana's ecosystem. **Fragmetric** and **SANG** contribute to the ecosystem through research, development, and releasing new NCN/AVS products, ensuring decentralization and growth.

    > We believe that restaking will provide new uses for tokens in the Solana ecosystem with the emergence of various decentralized services.
