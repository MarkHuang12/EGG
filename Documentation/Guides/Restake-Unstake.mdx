      <Step title="Connect Wallet to Fragmetric">
        If you don’t have a wallet yet, we recommend setting one up with Backpack or Phantom. You can check the currently supported wallet integrations in the image below. If you're using a hardware wallet like Ledger, make sure to enable the "I'm using a Hardware Wallet" toggle.

      <Step title="Choose Amount to (re)stake as fragSOL">
        Enter the amount you wish to deposit into fragSOL. Ensure the amount is less than your total balance. You should also keep some SOL in your wallet (at least 0.1) for Solana rent fees. (Fragmetric does not profit from any portion of the rent fee)

    ## How to unstake fragAsset

    Once you submit an unstake request, it will be placed in a queue and become claimable after 3 epochs (up to approximately 10 days). During this period, Fragmetric handles the following on your behalf:

    * **Undelegating tokens** from the node operator

    * **Retrieving tokens** from the restaking vault

    * **Unstaking to Solana**

    <Info>
      Please note there is a **0.2% withdrawal fee** for each unstake request, which helps cover expenses associated with the Jito (Re)staking platform.

      </Step>

      <Step title="Enter an Amount">
        Specify how much fragSOL you want to unstake. Click **Max** if you want to unstake your entire balance. The "Receive" amount displayed at this stage is an estimate. Your actual withdrawal amount may differ when the unstaking process completes.
