    ## Key rules of F Point

    <Accordion title="Wrapping" defaultOpen={false}>
      * When wrapping, all boost except for the referral boost are removed.

      * Simply holding wfragAsset does not earn F Points.

      * If deposited into DeFi protocol, the corresponding boost for that pool applies.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Unwrapping" defaultOpen={false}>
      * When unwrapping, if a referral is already registered, the referral boost will apply, but all other boosts will not be reapplied.

      * To reactivate the Backpack boost, unstake first and then restake again using your Backpack wallet.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Unstaking" defaultOpen={false}>
      * If you stake multiple times, the same asset may have different boost levels.

      * In this case, when you unstake, the asset with the lowest boost will be unstaked first.

    ## fragSOL & fragJTO

    When holding $fragmetric Asset, F Points are credited in real-time without the need for additional procedures. The number of F Points awarded follows the formula:

    $F\text\{ points} = \text\{Total Fragmetric Asset held } (n) \times&#x20;

    \text\{time staked in seconds } (t) \times&#x20;

    \text\{fragmetric Asset Accrual rate } (e)$

    ### Example Calculation

    Assume you have deposited 1 fragSOL. After one full day (86,400 seconds), the increase in F Points is calculated using fragSOL’s accrual rate of 0.001. Specifically, multiply the deposit amount (1 fragSOL), the accrual rate (0.001), and the elapsed time (86,400 seconds) to determine the additional F Points accrued.

    </Frame>

    Therefore, after 24 hours, the F Points would increase by 86.4 for every 1 fragSOL staked.

    ## wfragSOL & wfragJTO

    F point accumulation occurs only when used in a DeFi protocol after wrapping. Simply holding wrapped fragSOL or wrapped fragJTO does not accumulate F points.

    ## Accrual rate per Asset

    The accrual rate for a $fragmetric Asset is determined by the deposit asset’s value at the time of the $fragmetric Asset’s launch, ensuring fairness across different types of deposit assets.

    **Accural rate list**

    * fragSOL : 0.001

    * fragJTO : 0.00002

  <Tab title="F Points Boost">
    ### **Calculation of Point Boosting**

    * The additional F Points are calculated by multiplying the base F Points by the boost multiplier.

    * The formula used to calculate the boosted F Points is as follows:
