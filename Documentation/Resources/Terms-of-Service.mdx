These terms of use are entered into by and between you and Fragmetric Labs Inc. ("**Fragmetric**," "**we**," or "**us**"). The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, "**Terms of Use**"), govern your access to and use of [https://fragmetric.xyz](https://fragmetric.xyz/?ref=docs.fragmetric.xyz) (the “**Website**”) and Fragmetric’s online and mobile applications (“**Apps**”), including any content, protocol, functionality, and services offered on or through the Website or the Apps (collectively, the “**Services**”), whether as a guest or a registered user.

Fragmetric may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, to provide you with a requested service, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms of Use. In such cases, Fragmetric, in its sole discretion, may disable your account in connection with the Services and block your ability to access the Services until such additional information and documents are processed by us. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to such a request, we may refuse to restore your access to the Services.

### <u>Changes to the Terms of Use</u>

We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Services thereafter.

Your continued use of the Services following the posting of revised Terms of Use means that you accept and agree to the changes. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of a Service through the Site or public communication channels. You are expected to check this page from time to time so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

We reserve the right to withdraw or amend all or any part of the Services, and any service or material we provide as part of the Services, in our sole discretion without notice.

To access the Services or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information.

However, we do not undertake to review all User Content before it is posted on the Services and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable User Content after it has been posted.

We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or non-performance of the activities described in this section.

We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Services, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents.

### <u>Disclaimer of Warranties and Risks</u>

You understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the internet or the Services will be free of viruses or other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY A DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACK, VIRUSES, OR OTHER TECHNOLOGICALLY HARMFUL MATERIAL THAT MAY INFECT YOUR COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, DATA, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY MATERIAL DUE TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES OR YOUR DOWNLOADING OF ANY MATERIAL POSTED ON IT, OR ON ANY SERVICES LINKED TO IT.

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, ITS CONTENT, AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SERVICES, ITS CONTENT (INCLUDING ANY NON-USER OR USER CONTENT), AND ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. NEITHER FRAGMETRIC NOR ANY PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH FRAGMETRIC MAKES ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPLETENESS, SECURITY, RELIABILITY, QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, NEITHER FRAGMETRIC NOR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH FRAGMETRIC REPRESENTS OR WARRANTS THAT THE SERVICES, ITS CONTENT, OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE, OR UNINTERRUPTED, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT OUR SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT THE SERVICES OR ANY SERVICES OR ITEMS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL OTHERWISE MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, FRAGMETRIC HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY WARRANTIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

ADDITIONALLY, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND, ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOLLOWING:

(A)            THE SERVICES RELY ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS CRYPTOGRAPHIC AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED TECHNOLOGIES. THERE ARE INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED TECHNOLOGIES, DIGITAL ASSETS AND SYSTEMS THAT INTERACT WITH BLOCKCHAIN-BASED NETWORKS. YOU AGREE AND UNDERSTAND THAT FRAGMETRIC DOES NOT OWN OR CONTROL ANY OF THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE THROUGH WHICH BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS (SUCH AS THE SOLANA BLOCKCHAIN) ARE FORMED. IN GENERAL, THE SOFTWARE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS, IS OPEN SOURCE, SUCH THAT ANYONE CAN USE, COPY, MODIFY, AND DISTRIBUTE IT. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE (I) THAT FRAGMETRIC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATION OF THE BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS UNDERLYING THE SERVICES, (II) THAT THERE EXISTS NO GUARANTEE OF THE FUNCTIONALITY, SECURITY, OR AVAILABILITY OF THAT SOFTWARE AND NETWORKS, AND (III) THAT THE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAIN-BASED NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO SUDDEN CHANGES IN OPERATING RULES, SUCH AS THOSE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “FORKS,” WHICH MAY MATERIALLY AFFECT THE SERVICES.

(B)            WHEN PROVIDING LIQUIDITY THROUGH ANY PROTOCOL MADE AVAILABLE BY US, YOU MAY FACE LIQUIDITY RISK. THIS MEANS THAT DURING TIMES OF HIGH VOLATILITY, MARKET DOWNTURNS, OR LOW DEMAND FOR THE TOKEN PAIRS IN LIQUIDITY POOLS, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHDRAW YOUR STAKED DERIVATIVE TOKENS IN FULL. FURTHER, IF THE TOTAL VALUE LOCKED IN THE LIQUIDITY POOL DECREASES OR SHIFTS DUE TO MARKET ACTIVITY, YOUR PROPORTION OF THE POOL MAY LOSE VALUE RELATIVE TO THE UNDERLYING TOKENS. YOU MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE IMPERMANENT LOSS, WHICH REFERS TO THE TEMPORARY LOSS OF VALUE EXPERIENCED WHEN HOLDING LIQUIDITY TOKENS VERSUS HOLDING THE ORIGINAL TOKENS OUTSIDE OF THE POOL.

(C)           WHEN YOU STAKE ASSETS ON A PROOF-OF-STAKE NETWORK, YOUR TOKENS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF SLASHING, WHICH OCCURS WHEN VALIDATORS ON THE NETWORK FAIL TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS (E.G., VALIDATOR DOWNTIME OR MALICIOUS BEHAVIOR). SLASHING RESULTS IN A PARTIAL OR COMPLETE LOSS OF YOUR STAKED ASSETS. SINCE LIQUIDITY RESTAKING INVOLVES STAKING DERIVATIVE TOKENS (LIKE STETH OR STSOL) THAT REPRESENT UNDERLYING STAKED ASSETS, ANY SLASHING EVENT ON THE ORIGINAL NETWORK CAN AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE TOKENS. ADDITIONALLY, SLASHING CAN ALSO OCCUR ON THE SECONDARY NETWORKS FOR STAKED OR RESTAKED ASSETS, WHICH MAY ALSO AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE TOKENS. IN EXTREME CASES, SLASHING COULD RESULT IN THE COMPLETE LOSS OF THE RESTAKED ASSETS IN LIQUIDITY POOLS.

(D)           LIQUIDITY RESTAKING INVOLVES THE USE OF DERIVATIVE TOKENS (SUCH AS $jitoSOL, $mSOL, $bSOL, or $INF OR OTHER STAKING DERIVATIVES), WHICH ARE ISSUED BY THIRD-PARTY STAKING SERVICES. THE VALUE OF THESE TOKENS MAY DIVERGE FROM THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING STAKED ASSETS DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS, LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS, OR SYSTEMIC RISKS IN THE STAKING SERVICE ITSELF. THESE DERIVATIVE TOKENS MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO DE-PEGGING EVENTS, WHERE THEIR VALUE DEVIATES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE UNDERLYING ASSET THEY REPRESENT.

(E)            THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR DECENTRALIZED FINANCE, STAKING, AND LIQUIDITY RESTAKING IS RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND MAY DIFFER ACROSS JURISDICTIONS. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR UNDERSTANDING AND COMPLYING WITH ANY LOCAL LAWS, REGULATIONS, OR RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY APPLY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. WE CANNOT AND DO NOT PROVIDE ANY LEGAL, FINANCIAL, OR REGULATORY ADVICE. FRAGMETRIC MAKES NO REPRESENTATION AS TO WHETHER THE SERVICES ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION, AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE SERVICES IS LAWFUL. ADDITIONALLY, THE SERVICES AND ANY DIGITAL ASSETS YOU ACQUIRE THROUGH THE SERVICES COULD BE IMPACTED BY ONE OR MORE REGULATORY INQUIRIES OR REGULATORY ACTIONS, WHICH COULD IMPEDE OR LIMIT THE ABILITY OF FRAGMETRIC TO CONTINUE TO MAKE AVAILABLE OUR SERVICES TO YOU.

(F)            THE CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKETS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR HIGH VOLATILITY. THE VALUE OF THE STAKED TOKENS, DERIVATIVE TOKENS, AND ASSETS WITHIN LIQUIDITY POOLS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY IN RESPONSE TO MARKET CONDITIONS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A RISK OF SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL LOSS, AND THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE A COMMON FEATURE OF THE DIGITAL ASSET MARKETS.

(G)           YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND USE OF THE SERVICES IS HIGHLY RISKY IN NATURE. YOU ACCEPT THAT YOU MAY SUSTAIN TOTAL OR PARTIAL LOSS OF ALL ASSETS, TOKENS OR REWARDS STAKED OR ACQUIRED THROUGH THE SERVICES.

### <u>Limitation on Liability</u>

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL FRAGMETRIC, ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OFFICERS, OR DIRECTORS BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICES, ANY SERVICES LINKED TO IT, ANY CONTENT ON THE SERVICES OR SUCH OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE.

THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

### <u>Indemnification</u>

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Fragmetric, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these Terms of Use or your use of the Services (including any risks arising out of such use), including, but not limited to, your User Content, any use of the Services other than as expressly authorized in these Terms of Use, or your use of any information obtained from the Services.

### <u>Force Majeure</u>

We will not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted under or breached these Terms of Use, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any of our obligations under these Terms of Use or in providing the Services, when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from any events beyond our ability to control, including acts of God; flood, fire, earthquake, epidemics, pandemics, tsunami, explosion, war, invasion, hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, government order, law, or action, embargoes or blockades, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, shortage of adequate or suitable Internet connectivity, telecommunication breakdown or shortage of adequate power or electricity, and other similar events beyond our control.

### <u>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</u>

All matters relating to the Services and these Terms of Use, and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of British Virgin Islands.

### <u>Arbitration</u>

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

### <u>Waiver and Severability</u>

No waiver by Fragmetric of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Fragmetric to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

### <u>Entire Agreement</u>

The Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy and such other terms and conditions as made available by us by way of the Services from time to time constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Fragmetric regarding the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Services.
