"Unwrap" converts Wrapped FRAG (**wFRAG**) tokens back into original FRAG assets. It ensures accurate redemption of underlying assets and appropriate reward management within FRAG-22.

## Why Unwrap?

Unwrapping wFRAG tokens into original FRAG assets allows users to:

- **Retrieve Original Assets:** Redeem underlying FRAG tokens at any point.
- **Claim Rewards:** Access accumulated rewards and settle any outstanding balances associated with their token holdings.
- **Rebalance Holdings:** Adjust their asset allocation according to changing market conditions or investment strategies.

1. **User Initiates Unwrapping**

   Users request unwrapping by returning wrapped FRAG tokens (wFRAG) back to FRAG-22.

2. **Reserve Account Validation**

   The Reserve Account confirms the wFRAG token authenticity and the user's token balance.

3. **Burn wFRAG Tokens**

   Once validated, the corresponding amount of wFRAG tokens is burned to maintain accurate total supply records.

4. **Release Underlying FRAG Assets**

   The Reserve Account releases the equivalent original FRAG tokens to the user's wallet.

5. **Update Reward Accounts**

   Reward contributions and balances are recalculated and settled based on the final holdings after unwrapping.
