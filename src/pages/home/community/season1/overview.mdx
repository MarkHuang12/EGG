  <Tab title="Season 1">
    The launch of Fragmetric's LF(ra)G campaign, Season 1, is a testament to our commitment to pushing the boundaries of Solana. Designed to ensure the safety and security of protocol development while optimizing the user experience, this campaign is structured into multiple brick-by-brick phases, providing participants with a secure and efficient environment where their SOL works for them.

    As a Jito (re)staking VRT provider, Fragmetric has structured Season 1 to run through to the TGE, strengthening Solana’s decentralization, enhancing protocol collaboration, and empowering more participants to contribute to the acceleration of decentralization.

    ## Key rules of F Point

    <Accordion title="Wrapping" defaultOpen={false}>
      * When wrapping, all boost except for the referral boost are removed.

      * Simply holding wfragAsset does not earn F Points.

      * If deposited into DeFi protocol, the corresponding boost for that pool applies.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Unwrapping" defaultOpen={false}>
      * When unwrapping, if a referral is already registered, the referral boost will apply, but all other boosts will not be reapplied.

      * To reactivate the Backpack boost, unstake first and then restake again using your Backpack wallet.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Unstaking" defaultOpen={false}>
      * If you stake multiple times, the same asset may have different boost levels.

      * In this case, when you unstake, the asset with the lowest boost will be unstaked first.
    </Accordion>

    ## fragSOL & fragJTO

    When holding $fragmetric Asset, F Points are credited in real-time without the need for additional procedures. The number of F Points awarded follows the formula:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/src/assets/images/point_1.png" />
    </Frame>

    <Frame>
      <img src="/src/assets/images/point_2.png" />
    </Frame>

    ### Example Calculation

    Assume you have deposited 1 fragSOL. After one full day (86,400 seconds), the increase in F Points is calculated using fragSOL’s accrual rate of 0.001. Specifically, multiply the deposit amount (1 fragSOL), the accrual rate (0.001), and the elapsed time (86,400 seconds) to determine the additional F Points accrued.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/src/assets/images/point_3.png" />
    </Frame>

    Therefore, after 24 hours, the F Points would increase by 86.4 for every 1 fragSOL staked.

    ## wfragSOL & wfragJTO

    F point accumulation occurs only when used in a DeFi protocol after wrapping. Simply holding wrapped fragSOL or wrapped fragJTO does not accumulate F points.

    </Frame>

    ## Accrual rate per Asset

    The accrual rate for a $fragmetric Asset is determined by the deposit asset’s value at the time of the $fragmetric Asset’s launch, ensuring fairness across different types of deposit assets.

    **Accural rate list**

    * fragSOL : 0.001

    * fragJTO : 0.00002

  <Tab title="F Points Boost">
    ## Calculation of Point Boosting

    * The additional F Points are calculated by multiplying the base F Points by the boost multiplier.

    * The formula used to calculate the boosted F Points is as follows:

      <img src="/src/assets/images/boost_1.png" />
    </Frame>

    ### Example

    If a user earns 1 base F Point and a boost multiplier of ×1.3 is applied, the calculation would be:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/src/assets/images/boost_2.png" />
    </Frame>

    Thus, in this case, the user would receive 1.3 F Points instead of the standard 1 F Point due to the 1.3x boost. This system allows users to earn more F Points by leveraging the point boost, which enhances their rewards based on the boost multiplier applied.

    ## Partner Boost

    <Frame>
      <img src="/src/assets/images/boost_3.png" />
    </Frame>

    When users stake through the Backpack wallet, they are rewarded with a 1.3x partner boost on their F Points. This boost ensures users earn 30% more F Points than the base amount they would receive under normal circumstances.
