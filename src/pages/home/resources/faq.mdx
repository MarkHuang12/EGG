## What is Fragmetric?

What is Fragmetric?

Fragmetric began as Solana’s first native Liquid Restaking Protocol, introducing Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs) to maximize staking and DeFi yields. Expanding into FRAG-22, Fragmetric unified diverse assets — including SOL, LSTs, and SPL tokens — into a single composable framework, streamlining strategic asset allocation and yield optimization.

FRAG-22’s modular architecture — Fund, Reward, Yield Source, Normalized Token Pool, and Operator modules — enables precise reward tracking, secure asset management, and efficient liquidity handling. By delivering transparent, automated, and scalable asset management, Fragmetric defines the new standard for Yield Generating Assets on Solana.

## What is Fragmetric's Mission?

Starting as the first Solana native liquid restaking protocol, Fragmetric aims to bridge the gap between Solana’s main network and the evolving landscape of off-chain consensus systems such as oracles, bridges, and Keeper networks. These systems require robust economic security aligned with Solana’s core consensus to ensure overall network stability.

Fragmetric aggregates user deposits — including SOL, Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), and various SPL tokens — and strategically restakes them to provide unified security and enhanced liquidity management. By doing so, we protect user assets and ensure alignment of incentives between Solana’s mainnet and off-chain ecosystems.

Expanding beyond restaking, Fragmetric sets a new standard - FRAG-22 - to integrate diverse yield-generation methods into a unified, composable token architecture. Our ultimate vision is to build a secure, transparent, and highly efficient liquidity layer that sustainably aggregates retail liquidity, optimizes risk management, and maximizes returns, supporting the broader economic and security ecosystem of Solana.

## Why should I care?

Securing both the Solana network and additional networks might seem unrelated to why you would use Fragmetric. To put it simply, Fragmetric helps activate and sustain numerous off-chain consensus networks, DeFi apps, and other services, which in turn provide you with additional yield on your deposits. By depositing with Fragmetric and leaving it to work, you will continuously earn rewards for as long as the Solana network exists (which is effectively forever).

## What’s fragAsset?

fragAsset is a receipt Token that serves as a representation of one's position in the Fragmetric protocol. In the same way that JitoSOL, BNSOL, bbSOL are Liquid Staking Tokens that offer users their staking position, fragAsset offers them their deposit position. You are able to claim your rewards coming from restaking protocols, staking protocols, App, and Defi if you have fragAsset and use it inside DeFi apps at the same time.

## How do I receive my rewards?

fragAsset automatically compounds staking and MEV rewards if the underlying deposit produces them (e.g., SOL or other LSTs), causing its value to grow over time. If the deposited asset does not generate staking or MEV rewards, you will only receive NCN/AVS rewards through the protocol.

These NCN/AVS rewards accumulate in a dedicated reserve account, and any holder with at least one slot of fragAsset can claim them. The amount of rewards you receive is proportional to both your holding period and the quantity of fragAsset you own. For instance, fragSOL is one type of fragAsset that combines automatic compounding from SOL-based yields with NCN/AVS rewards.

## Where are my tokens stored?

When you deposit tokens, they are transferred to the Fragmetric fund account, which securely holds user assets. For fragAsset that require normalization (e.g., those representing multiple token types), nTOKEN (normalized Token) is minted in proportion to the deposited amount. The resulting nTOKEN is then restaked and delegated across various NCN and AVS platforms.

In cases where normalization is not necessary, the deposited tokens are directly restaked without needing to convert them into nTOKEN. This flexible approach ensures efficient handling of different asset types within the Fragmetric ecosystem.

## How do I get F points?

F Point is the first reward provided by Fragmetric through its protocol’s reward module. To participate, simply hold your fragAsset in your wallet and verify that the reward system is activated using your wallet address.
