wfragSOL is wrapped versions of fragSOL, designed for broader DeFi compatibility. Some DeFi protocols do not support Token Extension (also known as Token-2022), an advanced token program on the Solana blockchain. To address this, wfragSOL is created as DeFi-compatible version of fragSOL, with the wrapped tokens pegged to its respective token.
