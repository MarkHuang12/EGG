fragJTO is the first non-SOL Liquid Restaking Token (LRT) introduced by Fragmetric. By staking JTO, the governance token of the Jito Protocol, you receive fragJTO, which represents your staked JTO and entitles you to:

* **MEV Rewards:** Your JTO is utilized to secure **TipRouter**, a core component of the MEV ecosystem on Solana. The MEV tips generated here are shared with fragJTO holders, enhancing overall APY.

* **Additional Restaking Revenue:** With integrations on the Jito (Re)staking Protocol, including collaborations with NCNs, Fragmetric efficiently redistributes extra restaking rewards to fragJTO holders.

> Rewards within the protocol are distributed in two ways: when Jito (Re)staking rewards arrive in JTO that can be deposited back into fragJTO, the protocol uses auto-compounding to grow fragJTO’s APY. If the rewards are paid in tokens not supported by the protocol, users can manually claim those tokens at any time. This dual model maximizes yields for fragJTO while ensuring users maintain direct control over any non-compounding rewards.
