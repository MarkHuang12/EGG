wfragJTO are wrapped versions of fragJTO, designed for broader DeFi compatibility. Some DeFi protocols do not support Token Extension (also known as Token-2022), an advanced token program on the Solana blockchain. To address this, wfragJTO was created as DeFi-compatible version of fragJTO, with the wrapped tokens pegged to its respective token.
